A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm. Some authors restrict the term “programming
language” to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:
Function and target

A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation[5] or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots,[6] and so on.
For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.
Abstractions

Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a
 
 
abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle.[9] This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.
Expressive power :Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming languages. Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined. XSLT, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using


XML syntax. Moreover, LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset
Elements : All programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively and one of them is called syntax A programming
language’s surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.
Design and implementation: Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related languages branching one from another and it’s properties that Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers and Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from
 
 
Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification
Use:

Programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available called primitives. Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt


existing ones to new uses or a changing environment. Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the commands are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface, without compiling, it is called a scripting language and there are various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language the number of books sold that teach or describe the language estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language – which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches.
